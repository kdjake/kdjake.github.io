                        <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
                        <p style="text-align: left;">A survey was conducted among various data professionals to gather insights into different aspects of their careers, including average salary, preferred programming language, and ease of transitioning into the field. The goal was to provide aspiring data professionals with a better understanding of the profession in terms of effort and reward. The survey targeted Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Data Analysts, Data Architects, and Database Developers, and was distributed via selected social media platforms using purposive sampling. Data was collected through an online survey form and analyzed using various tools, including Microsoft SQL Server, DAX functions, Power Query, and Excel. The findings were presented in a dashboard format using PowerBI to demonstrate proficiency in business intelligence solutions.<span style="color: rgb(15, 15, 15);">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

                                <p style="text-align: left;">This survey aims to provide insights into the data industry by gathering information from data professionals. The goal is to depict the current state of the industry regarding preferred programming languages, salary ranges, job satisfaction, and other factors. The findings will be utilized to generate recommendations and facilitate growth and smooth transition into the field.<span style="color: rgb(15, 15, 15);">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

                                <p style="text-align: left;">The analysis showed that<strong> Data Scientists</strong> had the <strong>highest average salary</strong> among other data professionals, earning <strong>$93,800</strong>, which is consistent with industry job board data from Glassdoor and Indeed. The Finance sector was identified as the most lucrative industry. <strong>Python was the top programming language</strong>, with 67% of respondents preferring it. Most respondents (72%) found it either "very easy" or "neither easy nor difficult" to transition into the field, but satisfaction with salary scored only 4.27 out of 10.<span style="color: rgb(15, 15, 15);">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

                                <p style="text-align: left;">The study had some limitations, such as a majority of responses being from Data Analysts and the exclusion of SQL from the list of programming languages. The report did not cover the full scope of possible analysis.&nbsp; Therefore, to gain a complete understanding of the findings, it is recommended that those interested in the information or considering a career transition in data should interact with the dashboard.<span style="color: rgb(15, 15, 15);">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
